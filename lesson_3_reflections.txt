When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1. If you happen to be on a different computer and unable to work on the project on home computer.
2. When openly collaborating on all changes in a product. 
3. When making changes and testing them out on Github :)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If people are changing the repository, they could change the code out from underneath you.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch is just a different path for the code in a repository
A clone is a copy of code files and their git repositories to a local computer
A fork is a copy from one Github account to another.
