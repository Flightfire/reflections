When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1. If you happen to be on a different computer and unable to work on the project on home computer.
2. When openly collaborating on all changes in a product. 
3. When making changes and testing them out on Github :)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If people are changing the repository, they could change the code out from underneath you.
